# Duck-Pool

This is a school project I made in Java. We had to do a pool with rocks 
and water lilies where ducks could born, move around the pool without going 
out or being in a place were there is a rock. They could eat water lilies and grow as they do so.
If a duck became king size he would become a big duck and change color, he would also whistle sometimes.

## Launch the project

There is a .jar file in the executable folder you can launch. 
Don't forget to download the ressources too, they must be in the same folder as the .jar file.

## More

There is an explanation of the code in the .pdf file.
Careful it's in french.
